# Builds the GitHub Release description: one row per plugin actually
# packaged by build.sh, with its toolkit(s) and a link to its README.md
# (pinned to this release's tag so the link doesn't drift as the plugin
# changes on master later) when one exists.
#
# Usage: generate_release_notes.sh <repo "owner/name"> <tag> > notes.md
